					<div id="aboutMe">
						I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and
						intuitive programs, as well as interface designs. When I'm not coding or
						pushing pixels, you'll find me doing some of the following things:

					<b><i>Taking on a Food Challenge!</i></b> </br>
						I love to eat and experience flavors. I am not a chef, just a girl who really
						loves to eat, and cook. I enjoy trying new foods, cooking new recipes and trying new 
						spins on classic meals. I don't love everything, but I love trying everything!
					</div>
					
					<div id="aboutMe_helpingOthers">
					<b><i>Helping Others</i></b> </br>
						I am passionate about helping people accomplish far more than they ever thought was 
						possible. One way I accomplish this is by teaching people how 
						to code. I currently teach basic HTML to local middle school students and
						basic Python to college students. Another way I strive to help others is through
						mentoring. This year I have the privilege to serve as a mentor for two freshmen in the Georgetown 
						Scholarship Program.
					</div>
					
					<div id="aboutMe_familyTime">
					<b><i>Spending Time With My Family</i></b> </br>
						I enjoy many things in life, but what I really enjoy the most is spending time with my
						family. I have five fabulous sisters, two thoughtful brothers, precious parents, and a
						awesome little dog. When I am home, we enjoy volunteering, going on outdoor adventures,
						cooking together.
